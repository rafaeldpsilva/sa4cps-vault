RQ1. How can intelligent buildings dynamically model and adapt to the user’s individual and group preferences using graph-based heterogeneous representations? 

RQ2. In what ways can LLMs and SLMs be employed, not only to infer user intent and contextual relevance, but also to interact with occupants through dialog for clarification, negotiation, and preference definition? 

RQ3. How can an agent identify a user's latent needs and autonomously discover, negotiate for, and deploy and use containerized services to address them? 

RQ4. What mechanisms are required to enable peer-to-peer sharing of resources, such as computational availability and sensor data, between the autonomous agents of different users while preserving privacy and individual control?
