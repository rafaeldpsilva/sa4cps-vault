## Convergence of GNNs, LLMs, and Edge Computing in User-Centric Smart Environments: A Systematic Review
(WP1)

#### **Background**
Smart building environments increasingly integrate heterogeneous intelligent systems to provide personalized, energy-efficient services. Three technological domains have evolved independently: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable modeling of complex spatial-temporal-user relationships; Large Language Models (LLMs) provide natural language interfaces for intuitive system interaction; and Edge Computing architectures enable local processing to preserve privacy and reduce latency. Despite maturation in each domain, the literature lacks comprehensive synthesis of how these technologies converge in integrated, real-time, privacy-preserving applications.

#### **General Problem**
Current research on intelligent building systems addresses Graph Neural Networks, Large Language Models, and Edge Computing in disciplinary silos, resulting in fragmented knowledge about their synergistic application in user-centric, resource-constrained environments.

#### **Specific Problem**
Absent from the literature is a systematic synthesis examining how GNN-based relational modeling, LLM-driven natural language interaction, and edge-constrained computational architectures converge to enable context-aware building intelligence. Existing reviews examine these technologies in isolation, GNNs without natural language interfaces, LLMs without graph-structured data, or edge frameworks without semantic reasoning, obscuring critical integration challenges including interoperability protocols, computational resource allocation, privacy-preserving knowledge representation, and unified architectural patterns.

#### **Research Gap**
It is not known what the current literature reveals about:
1. Architectural frameworks for integrating GNN-based modeling with LLM interfaces on edge infrastructure
2. Interoperability challenges and trade-offs when unifying these three technological domains
3. Performance characteristics (latency, accuracy, privacy) in hybrid GNN-LLM-Edge deployments
4. Unexplored research directions at the convergence of these technologies

#### **Significance**
This gap creates three critical barriers: 
1. theoretical fragmentation prevents unified conceptual models across computer science subdisciplines,
2. practitioners cannot identify proven architectural patterns, forcing redundant implementation efforts, and 
3. white spaces for novel contributions remain invisible. Affected stakeholders include academic researchers in HCI/IoT/AI, building automation developers, privacy advocates, and facility managers seeking cost-effective personalization.

#### **Research Question**
**Primary**: What does existing literature reveal about the convergence of Graph Neural Networks, Large Language Models, and Edge Computing for user-centric smart building environments?

**Sub-Questions**:
- RQ1.1: What architectural frameworks have been proposed for integrating these three technologies?
- RQ1.2: What technical challenges are documented in convergence attempts?
- RQ1.3: What performance trade-offs have been reported?
- RQ1.4: What research gaps and future directions are identified?
